## Installation

### Option 1: Direct Download (Recommended)

```bash
# Download and install binary
curl -L https://github.com/gappa55/maccleanup-rust/releases/download/v1.2.0/maccleanup-rust -o maccleanup-rust
chmod +x maccleanup-rust

# Asks before each cleanup action
```

### Dry Run Mode

```

### Force Mode
```bash
maccleanup-rust --force
# Cleans everything without prompts (use with caution!)
```

### RAM Only Mode
```bash
maccleanup-rust --ram-only
# Only cleans RAM memory
```

### Verbose Mode
```bash
maccleanup-rust --verbose
# Shows detailed information during cleanup
```

## What Gets Cleaned

- **System Caches**: `~/Library/Caches`, `~/.cache`
- **System Logs**: `~/Library/Logs` (files older than 7 days)
- **Downloads**: `~/Downloads` (files older than 30 days)
- **Trash**: `~/.Trash`
- **Xcode**: DerivedData, Archives (if Xcode installed)
- **Homebrew**: Cache and outdated formulae (if Homebrew installed)
- **Node.js**: `node_modules` directories
- **Docker**: Unused containers, images, volumes (if Docker installed)
- **Safari**: Cache and history
- **Chrome**: Browser cache
- **Python**: `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files
- **RAM**: Inactive memory (requires sudo)

## Safety Features

- **Age-based filtering**: Only removes old files (7+ days for logs, 30+ days for downloads)
- **System file protection**: Skips important system files like `.DS_Store`
